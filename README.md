Greetings and salutations.  
Welcome to our repository of code, data, and presentation materials for our second case study. 

The purpose of this project was to investigate the " ".
We've included a RMD file with the source R code to support our claims as well as a Codebook (located in the code folder) explaining our table structures. 
Also included is a powerpoint with summary materials, and a PowerBI dashboard for some fun exploratory perusing at your own leisure. 

We'd like to thank you all for visiting our repository and know that this Readme was written entirely to the tune of ACDC.  

Love,
Team TAM
